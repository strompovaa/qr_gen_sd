# qr_generator 
QR Code generation using Stable Diffusion project 

Implementation
    -batch_image_generation: contains 2500 images with AQR codes, due to submition file size limit this file could not be submitted
    -model_performance: contains .json and .txt files with data about AQR codes from batch_image_generation, and python scripts for data processing
    -image_inference_jupyter_notebooks: notebooks with inference logic for AQR code generation
    -dreambooth: contains notebooks used for fine-tuning ControlNet models

Evaluation
    -promo_materials: materials used to display during the user study 
    -data processing scripts
